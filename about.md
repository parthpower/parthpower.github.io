You already know my name from the url. Just to clerify (for legal reasons lol) it's Parth Parikh. 

I work on system level softwares, used to design hardware on FPGA and ASIC in grad school, and not that I am an expert but I can write simple fullstack webapps that won't look so pretty but they will work for sure.

(a voice): But why? why do I care about all these stuff? can't I just be happy with one part of it? 

Actually, it feels good when you dig deeper into electronics, computers, and software of all level to get the full picture of the device you are reading this on. 

Still not satisfied with that answer? Hmmm...

I am a programmer and a geek. Sounds good now?


That's it for about me. You can follow on twitter, github, gitlab, and LinkedIn @parthpower.
