I'm an R&D embedded software engineer at [Keysight](https://keysight.com), an amazing place to work. To clarify, these blog reflects my personal opinions only.

This blog is about my journey through engineering, some software, some FPGA , some ASIC , and a tiny bit of webapps, too.

Used to write at [https://tiptogeek.com](https://tiptogeek.com) which is now out of service, and [https://superuser.blog](https://superuser.blog) which is still in service (maybe?).
