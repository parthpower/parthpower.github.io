This is Parth. R&D software engineer at [Keysight](https://keysight.com). Works on drivers, software plumbing, [p4](https://p4.org), and Kubernetes. Can be found playing with [p4](https://p4.org), Go, gRPC, and C++. Good with FPGA, low level system code, and all the hardware level stuff.Â Learned ASIC/FPGA design at university. Tries NodeJS but prefers pure JavaScript on Chrome DevConsol.

This blog is about my journey through engineering, some software, some FPGA , some ASIC , and a tiny bit of webapps, too.

Used to write at [https://tiptogeek.com](https://tiptogeek.com) which is now out of service, and [https://superuser.blog](https://superuser.blog) which is still in service (maybe?).
